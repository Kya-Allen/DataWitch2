# DataWitch2
A Computational Statistics/Machine Learning Library with an emphasis on lesser known methods for finding lower dimensional structure in data. Written in Rust and wrapped in python

## highlights
  - Clustering
    - Convex Clustering (L1 & L2 penalties)
  - Taxometrics (Taxometric Analysis)
    - Maximum Eigenvalue (MaxEig)
    - Mean Above Minus Below a Cut (MAMBAC)
    - CCFI w/ data simulation

pending soources. Convex Clustering methods are not of my own design and are based on conference papers and arxiv papers that I will add soon. Texometrix methods are of course not my own invention
